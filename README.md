# userVisualization
Dashboard to present to GBADs shareholders on our users locations, frequencies, and more.

## Purpose
Displaying the location of our users and their frequency of use will help us to better understand our users and their needs. This will help us to better serve our users and increase our user base.

## To run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `python3 dataLoader.py`

This pulls all the data from AWS that gets displayed to the users

3. Run `python3 app.py`

This runs the action dashboard that the user can interact with
